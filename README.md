Project Description 
- It is a flashcard website where a user can create, customize, and study flashcards. 

Technologies Used
- React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML


Challenges 
- We were not able to manage a complex data(db.json) so that a user can create and organize cards into decks. 
- We have limited option to study flashcards. 
- We have 12 components as of right now which we may reduce it and make cleaner and more organized code. 


Future Stretch Goals
- Work on db.json structure to allow users to organize cards into decks and different categories
--------> Use uuid to generate unique id’s for each flashcard in flashcard array
- Create multiple choice game as an alternitive option to study flashcards
- Work on CSS so the website is more user-friendly and visually soothing for learners
